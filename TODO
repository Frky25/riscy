What do we need to do:

* Clean up when statements. They are not used in an intuitive way, they are
  just used to add guards that depend on values from action value methods.
* Don't use FIFOF if we don't need to
* [bug] htifStall causes a problem with typing and printing at the same time
* Perf counters:
    - Add perf counters in a clean way
    - Link performance counter txt file with android.exe so you don't have to
      copy over the txt file to the FPGA
* Figure out if this notation can be legal:
    - let {addr: .phyPc, exception: .exMMU} = mmuResp.first;
* Cleanup BSV source (lib, etc.)
    - Use Fence interface even if not necessary
    - Redo CSRF Interface
    - Rely on [riscv-opcodes] or [riscv-meta] more
    - Performance Counters
* Improve Spike's HTIF for tandem verification
    - Console input doesn't stay synchronized.
* [procs] Make stop interface method send a "stopped" verification packet
